Quick Game Overview
===========================

**Deep in a fanatical country, a small band of over-equipped explorers are preparing for a big coup: the exhumation of an ancient underground temple without the knowledge of the population. But time is running out.

Will they be able to face the traps and creatures they will encounter on their way down?
Will they get their hands on the precious stones, and the archaeological treasures, about which ancient texts speak?

"The Temple of Nazur" is a highly narrative and multimedia-enhanced exploratory adventure role-playing game for 2 to 5 players. Total duration: 3h30 on average.



Presentation of the universe
==========================

On the whole, the world of Pangea is in the scientific state of the end of our 20th century on earth, but knowledge is monopolized by a small number of scientific centres, which jealously protect it; thus, few cities are equipped with electricity. Advanced sciences such as nuclear fission, space exploration, genetic manipulation, are being theorized, but it will take decades before the industrial fabric will allow them to develop.

**The Alifir Academy**, to which the protagonists are linked, specialises in **History-Geography, Quantum Physics and Astronomy**. She knows how to date (but not precisely) biological elements to Carbon14, and is finalizing a device capable of translating the obscure Akarite sacred runes.

The other advanced analyses (pollen recognition, DNA analysis, chemistry, etc.) are only feasible with the cooperation of the **foreign academies**, which would take advantage of this to obtain strong counterparts (financial or intellectual).

Various religions coexist, but the main one is the **"yodism "**, originating from Akaris, which worships an infinity of identical deities called "yods".


Session Scenario
==========================


Context of the expedition
-------------------------

**Sir Loyd Georges**, a retired man from the land of Sabarite (*Victorian England style*) who led a life of unsuccessful adventuring, is on the verge of bankruptcy. But thanks to his connections at the Alifir Academy, he learns of the existence of an ancient dissident temple in the **country of Akaris** (*a fanatical yodic theocracy, with an atmosphere of medieval Japan*).
He therefore mounted a last-chance expedition to bring back the jewels and artifacts that the shrine probably contained, before it was found and annihilated by the local religious leaders.

Taking advantage of population movements due to the annual pilgrimage of yodic devotees, Loyd Georges and his expedition infiltrate Akaris, with a **solid off-road truck**, and sophisticated equipment. They set up camp near the ruins of **the former heretic capital, Nazur**, a city "cursed and doomed to the forbidden" since its fall.
Then they get ready to blow up a hillside in a **violent thunderstorm**; the natives (for whom thunder is "the Wrath of the Yod") probably won't dare to go outside as long as the storm lasts.
If the alert is given by nearby inhabitants or soldiers (the "Akarite zealots"), the idea is to get out of the country through the poorly guarded hills, by speeding up the border guards.



Flow of a game
----------------------------

The general pattern is that players go deeper and deeper into the cave until they find the Holy of Holies in the yodic temple. During this exploration, they must collect as many gems and artifacts as possible, as well as clues about the history of this temple. Many heavy objects have to be lifted up on stretchers as they go along. When the storm subsides, Akarites come near the well dug in the hill. Loyd Georges and the other members of the expedition must then withdraw.

If the players were already wound up, everything's going well for them. Otherwise, they must find a way to escape, and join the truck; either by repelling the first assailants who descend into the well (peasants, or soldiers of the small garrison nearby), or via another exit: the canal despite the shark-snakes, or the collapsed exit tunnel, or the openings above the pagan temple, or by blowing up the sub-cavern of the yodic temple...
A chase, in and out of the cave, is possible.
During all this time, the two porters are, depending on the case, either with Loyd Georges or with the players.
The adventure ends when players join Loyd Georges' all-terrain truck (or die...).


Possible areas, in addition to those included in the description of each place:

- an explorer's corpse lies in the aquifer cavern, and additional clues or artifacts may be found on it
- a strange animal (stingray, octopus, land chameleon...) discreetly follows the adventurers as soon as they enter, and once spotted can be tamed (or fought).
- one of the porters loses his mind because of the mystical atmosphere of the Holy of Holies, and all these riches (succeed in calming him down)
- in the absence of a gas mask, one of the wearers has an oedema in the throat, as an allergic reaction to mould from the Holy of Holies (need to give him a tracheotomy?).



IMPORTANT - Player Briefing
---------------------------------------

**Exhibit the Universe of the planet Pangea.**

**Show the introductory video** (the hillside blowout).

**Complete the context of the expedition, the local atmosphere in Nazur.**

Give the **additional instructions** below orally.

    Loyd Georges has **known you all for a long time** and has therefore entrusted you with an extremely sensitive mission; certain tenuous clues suggest that this temple may have seen the transit of a **divine orb**, one of the three mythical jewels of the Akarite religion. An orb that would be luminous, **chanting**, and endowed (according to legends) with monstrous powers. Keep your senses alert, for such a discovery, however dangerous geopolitically, would be worth all the treasures of the world.

    A **watchman** will be left at the top of the hill to watch the surroundings. Loyd Georges will stay in the truck with the telecom operator. You will have to make a **radio point every 20 minutes** to indicate your situation.

    **Two faithful servants** of Loyd Georges (devoted quintag√©naires, but not little autonomous), will accompany you in the cave, mainly to go up, **as and when**, the finds on a stretcher (thanks to the powerful multi-wire winch installed at the top of the well); they are at the orders of the butler (who can **choose their names**).

    Your team is supposed to be **very communicative**, so from the moment they are in the same room, unless instructed otherwise, the characters know what each other is discovering *(this makes it possible to solve puzzles with several people, avoiding meta-games and absurd blocking situations)*.

    Finally, Loyd Georges encourages you to find a **just balance between safety and efficiency** : the adventurer is the best scout, and must secure the areas, but it can sometimes be useful to separate not to lose time, and find as soon as possible the yodic temple, which is supposed to be **"deeply buried "**.

**Finally, take stock of their equipment** (what they have on their body, on their belt, in their hand, in their backpack...), and of their **default walking order** .



Game system
=================

Distribution of roles
----------------------

The pre-drawn characters are designed to be very complementary in their skills and missions, with a few friction points (e.g. illegally resell, or keep for scientific study, the exceptional artifacts found).

Aim optimally at 3 players for a dynamic game, or 4 players for more complex interactions.

Here are the recommended characters according to the type of game (they can be the type they want) :

- 2 players: butler and archaeologist, the adventurer is in NPCs at their orders
- 3 players: butler, archaeologist and adventurer
- 4 players: add the naturalist to the team
- 5 players: separate the archaeologist into two twins, one "physical/geological" and the other "ancient languages" oriented, who share skills and equipment (see marks "A" and "B" in the character sheet).


Characteristics of the characters
-----------------------------------

The characters have characteristics from 1 to 5.
You have to do less or equal with a D6 to be successful. A 1 is an exceptional success, and 6 is a critical failure (fumble).

These characteristics should **very little use**: most actions are supposed to be in accordance with the character's expertise, and therefore **automatically succeed, unless the player does a fumble**. Most die rolls are therefore to evaluate **the "luck "**, the randomness of the game.

Characteristics of the characters :

- **constitution** : physical strength, endurance, health...
- **agility** : speed, suppleness, fighting...
- **observation** : detect a danger, find an object, note a silly detail...

In a (rare) fight, each action consists of an attack and a defense attempt.
The "damage" is narrative, and depends on the type of weapon, as well as the die roll (the lower the die roll, the more successful the attack is).

- value of the ATTACK: **agility**
- DEFENSE value: **max(agility - 2, 1)**


Accompanying media
---------------------------


The game master must have:

- the slide show containing the plans and images of the places visited, with bestiary and objects
- pawns representing players, carriers, and enemies
- plans (or artworks) of the different areas of the game, printed on paper to be able to place the pieces in them
- of the image recapitulating the arrangement of these places in space
- music and videos accompanying the script (especially the "sound of the orb")
- a clock to visually account for the passage of time in the game (optional)

Attention, the slideshow must be set to "manual mode" to **do not spoiler** the images of the game. In order to display the right images of the slideshow (e.g. in LibreOffice Impress or MS PowerPoint), it is best to do so on a secondary screen, facing the players, while the game master is viewing all the slides. In nomad mode, it is possible to project the slideshow on a touch tablet via USB or Wifi, with software such as *TwomonUSB* or *Splashtop Xdisplay*.

**Tip**: The "Summaries" section of this manual can be placed on the back of the Game Screen, so that it is accessible at all times.



Places and possible actions
=================================


Gameplays common to the whole game
-----------------------------------

- Players have to find their way through the space, to guess where the different passages may lead in relation to the outside geography, and find shortcuts.
- they must be careful about their position in the cave, and their marching order, which can be decisive in the event of an impromptu attack.
- they must think about adapting their equipment (gas mask, lighting or night vision devices...) before they have problems.
- the butler must make the most of the porters' round-trip trips; but he must remember to take into account the safety advice of the butler, and the archaeologist's recommendations (e.g., some artifacts must be kept on site to solve puzzles).
- Certain events and details are left to the DOJ's discretion, with suggestions of probability if the dice are to decide.



Outdoor hill
--------------------

- A porter asks the archaeologist how long the storm will last. Loyd George doesn't know that.
- Players should think about studying the storm intuitively [adventurer] or by analysing the weather reports (pressure, rainfall, winds...) [archaeologist], to see that the storm will last **2 hours maximum**.
- ask players if they have any questions for Loyd Georges or for the **guet**, while they are setting up the **winch**.


Aquifer cave
--------------------

- cave a little damp, with some stalactites/stalagmites
- **100m long**, gently sloping from the arrival point
- under the scree slopes caused by the drilling of the well, one guesses a **cut stone platform**, surrounded by a few steps, which the archaeologist could recognize as a forecourt of **pre-yodic procession tunnel**; possibility of clearing these scree slopes with explosives, to open a shortcut to the base camp.
- large and very old graffiti on the various walls, curses quite typical of the Akarites: **"Heretics, turn back before the Yod drown you in fire "**, **"Suffering and death to the ungodly "**...
- pinkish mushrooms** grow on the mounds to the northwest; they have mutated from their white, edible surface counterparts and are therefore **slight sleepers**.
- in the middle of the mounds is an old wooden chest; it contains a silver chalice connected to a firing device (1 kilo of black powder); it can be defused by cutting open the side of the chest.
- water fungi** grow in crevices in the southwest; it is an **unknown** (but edible) **species.
- the channel is below the rest of the cave, bordered by **3m of steep slope** (but climbable); two ducts open into it from the east, below the surface (it is possible to explore, while diving, the valve system described below).
- the channel is filled with **Sharks, or shark-snakes**, but they are afraid of moving lights; amphibious, they can slip out of the channel to hunt; they have a nest (holes in the rock) on the north face of the channel.
- the **deck is covered with pitch**, ; the slightest spark triggers **10 minutes** of fire and smoke, blocking the access, and alerting the surrounding area ; an old semi-buried wick starts from the pitch, and runs in a north-eastern direction.
- the **boat debris and pierced coins**, near the canal, are on a ledge at **1m50 from the water** ; it was a bait, intended to make intruders explode thanks to the **barrel of black powder** attached (with the same wick system as for the bridge) ; the powder (1 kilo) may be dry (2/3 chance).
- a **enormous monolith** in precarious equilibrium (a stalagmite whose base has been planed by runoff) is located in the central-eastern part of the cave (it can be used to crush an enemy in case of fighting).
- the wide eastern corridor is **fully flooded for 10m**, because of the conduits (one wide in the east, two thinner ones in the west) which respectively fill it and empty it of water (see diagram).
- in the northeast corner are **4 large levers** arranged in a square, initially vertical. They correspond to the enigma of the archaeologist's "beings of the air and the earth". They must be tilted each to their cardinal point of opening, so that more water can flow out of the flooded corridor. In the non-flooded area of the corridor, to the east (off the map), are the **2 other gates**, which should be left as they are, or tilted each to their cardinal point of closure (to speed up the emptying of the corridor).
- **2 wooden pistons** are located in the centre-east of the cave; they do not control valves, but each trigger the firing of one of the wicks (powder keg or pitch-covered bridge), if depressed.
- a **large isolated lever** is located south-east of the cave, near the canal outlet; it is marked with a fish inscription, and is initially leaning south. If tilted the other way, it closes the drain, and water gradually rises in the cave (making the ledge disappear at first to the boat debris).

- possible paths :

    - the tunnel to the north-west advances towards the pagan temple (but with seedlings)
    - the tunnel to the north-east leads outwards (but with large scree slopes)
    - the corridor to the east makes a basin (initially flooded), then descends to the cave of the yodic temple
    - the main canal becomes an underground gut (without oxygen) and after 50m it comes out of the hillside as a stream and flows into the river Nazuron



Pagan Temple
--------------

- the tunnel leading up to it is collapsed towards the end.

- Ancient Akarite graffiti on fallen stones: **"Thus ends all worship devoted to the infamous idols "**

- of the **very faint light** filters at the top of the landslide (only the backpacker sees it); a passage can be opened simply with an ice axe, leading to the pagan temple

- fairly dry cavity, less cool than the aquifer cave, and poorly lit by large but tortuous cracks in the ceiling

- Archaeologist's intuition: ancient Akarites blew up this pagan temple, but the pediment remained standing, although the tunnel leading to it collapsed.

- the cracks in the ceiling make it possible to reach the north side of the hill, after **15m** of climbing.

- if the distance to the surface is determined: the **tree roots**, visible on the ceiling, prove that these common Akaris trees will seek water at **exceptional depths**.

- the **nest of a forest yeti** (unrecognizable), in still green branches, is installed behind the columns; it is an **unknown species**, only mentioned in the local legends

- **1/3** chance that the yeti is in its nest and attacking the players.

- archaeologist] study the pediment to realize that it is a pagan temple very much older than Yodism, magnificently preserved, but too "cursed" to have been able to shelter later Yodic dissidents

- 3 pagan statues still intact can be sold for a good price.

- 1/3** chance of the yeti coming back wet if players study the statues or enlarge the passage to bring them back.



Tunnel to the outside
------------------------

- at the beginning of the tunnel, a **rarapper** holds a few wooden torches (a sign that people were coming from a lighted area).

- the tunnel leads to the north face of the hill, but is **blown** in the middle, in a natural way

- [archaeologist] using sonar: there's about 10 feet of rock** blocking the way

- [Butler] knows that the equivalent of three sticks of dynamite is needed to open the passage, otherwise you'll have to work your way through for a long time...



Yodic Temple Cave
---------------------------

- fairly dry cavity, but cooler than the aquifer cave
- a few tree roots visible on the ceiling [FIND CEILING SYNONYMS]
- building in good condition, solid columns, thick but unstable roof structure, unstable roof tiles, and mud-capped windows
- the archaeologist sees that it is a typical architecture of the temples of a civilization that died out a thousand years ago.
- the archaeologist knows that the recess next to the temple is just an ancient base for ritual fires.
- at the **top of the entrance portico**, there is a lodge, in which one usually finds a religious insignia; one can recover a **crossentar**, proving that yodic worshippers have claimed this pre-yodic place
- high and dark lizards on the wall in front of the temple; they shelter phosphorescent amphibious bats**, **species unknown**, which flee if disturbed (they come out of the cave via the underground channel, their luminous belly frightens shark snakes); brown guano** can be recovered from the ground of the lizards, with a high market value because it is radioactive (in addition to the radioactivity detector, the mass spectrometer can reveal it, by detecting unusual atoms).


Main Hall of the Pre-Yodic Temple
---------------------------------------------

**The central arch**, is empty, but typical of a monotheistic religion prior to Yodism; it is considered by the Akarites a respectable precursor, but now obsolete. It is possible to try to take off and bring back the ark, but it is long and difficult (requires **4 carriers** minimum).

Tree roots are visible on the ceiling, as in the pagan temple (**8m** to the surface). Dynamiting the ceiling of this room is a possibility (very risky) if the players are cornered in the cave.

In the small crypt of the yodic temple (which opens to the right of the arch), a huge (and extremely rare) **imperialaran** sleeps; it is a giant, venomous **lizard, usually fearful, except when its lodging is threatened; it has a bad sense of smell, sees in the dark, but only locates movements. Players can ignore him, or try to put him to sleep, or block his way out of his lair... but if they ignore him, he will eventually wake up and intercept passers-by. This varan usually passes through the chlamydes channel to get out of the cave.

By looking at the **back gallery** (between the columns and the wall), players may notice that it is not an original partition, it is much darker and crumbly (to make a breakthrough: ice axe or explosive).

A **trap (spring loaded stakes)** is triggered if you walk along the back gallery, walking on **one of the slabs**; it inflicts a serious injury to the thigh if the character is hit.

A **large metal cat flap**, sliding, is also visible at ground level, on the right side: it is not enough to pass large artifacts from the place.




Holy of Holies of the Yodic Temple
----------------------------------------


- **trap**: put on the **survival mask** when entering the Holy of Holies (musty smell and putrefaction), otherwise risk of lung infection after several days, due to infectious moulds
- it takes a little time for ** oxygen to come back** (torches go out initially)
- the Saint of the Saints is rather dry, but very cold, at 2-3¬∞C, probably due to the surrounding water tables
- main elements from left to right : **Tombstones erected, a warrior statue, a stack of objects, a well, a mural, a small pagoda, a coffee table**
- **important: huddled corpse**, hidden by the warrior statue

- a carrier proposes to have the **mini-geodes** everywhere
- disturbing detail: **traces of vandalism**, bumps and cuts, on wall decorations and many pieces of furniture, when examined; DOJ can make it look like huge scratches; *it's a teaser puzzle, solved in a later game*
- if the players think to look up, there are **karite sacred runes** randomly placed on the ceiling, on the side of the well.

- basic gems are scattered all over the room, under the dust...
- of **beautiful diamonds** are inlaid in the mural fresco
- players must analyze these gems to see if they are real, and which ones are worth picking up first (the **purple gems are fake**, worthless)

- if excavation of the ground in front of the erected tombstones: nothing special to dig up, because in this religion the dead are cremated and then their ashes put in the ground.
- large lichens cover the tombstones: they are the ones that generate the dangerous gas; under the lichens, traces of paintings, almost erased (to try to restore, in order to have the dates of death after the fall of Nazur).
- tombstones can be removed and brought back to be sold.
- the statue of the warrior has a name ("Bartzar"), and **sacred runes**, which will therefore only be deciphered by the Alifir Academy.
- the **cadaver** (behind the warrior statue) is naturally mummified; he wears an earth-coloured toga (very common in this country); if searched, around his neck he has a **gold vial** (contains a little Elixir Berserk) and a **brass key**.

- In the heap of items, players find a number of interesting elements: 2 skulls (which the adventurer can recognize as goat and dog), an empty keg, a rusty ship's propeller, pottery, a liturgical candle, and a bottle with a viscous deposit on the bottom** **2 skulls (which the adventurer can recognize as goat and dog)

  - the dog skull and the keg are useless.
  - the goat skull has its horns planed.
  - the bottle has a deposit of red plum liqueur at the bottom.
  - the propeller, the pottery, the candle, have an archaeological and commercial value.

- the semi-circular well is covered by a heavy iron grid, rusty but sophisticated; it is engraved **"Filter of Orthodoxy "** on the grid, in ancient Akarite
- the well is very little filled (20cm of water at the bottom), with a light layer of mud at the bottom
- some small **pearl fish**, which have become blind and translucent over generations, live in this water.
- at the bottom of the well, under the mud, there is a **halberd** (well blunt, **if it is an exceptional artefact, it has razulite inscriptions**), as well as a **hexagonal recess about 15cm in diameter**.

- the fresco is extremely fine, it contains yodic inscriptions and symbols
- on a flat surface underneath, there are traces of pigmentation; restoring this painting, we can read: **"When the Glow of Faith passes through the Sieve of Doctrine, the Glory of the Yod is manifested "** * *(reference to the riddle of the well)*
- on one side, is engraved the **Symbol of Strength**, with inside pictograms of **goat, mushroom, round fruit, and water** *(clue to the Berserk Elixir)*

- the small pagoda made of dried earth is locked; if anyone tries to force it with an ice axe, there is a big risk that it will collapse and damage its contents
- the **key of the pagoda** is the one around the neck of the corpse.
- in the pagoda, one can find **rolled scrolls (holy books of yodism, potentially a version specific to razulites), and a stone lantern** (if inspected, it is engraved **"Light of the faithful "**, in ancient akarite)

- the small furniture of the room (coffee table...) is a priori worthless

**Luminous Puzzle**: if one wedges the stone lantern in the hollow at the bottom of the well, places any light in it, and then puts the grid over it, the interference effects bring to light certain sacred runes on the ceiling, which in reality form a Razulite prophecy after the fall of Nazur; this prophecy will only be deciphered by the Alifir Academy, but at least the ideogram of the "divine orbs" can be recognized.

After a while (earlier, if mini-geodes have been placed everywhere), a **weird whistle** is heard (cf dedicated soundtrack): the **song of the orb**. Its origin is very difficult to find by ear. You have to sound the walls with sonar, or use the microphone kit, to find out which wall to dig with an ice axe. The orb is prominently displayed in its hiding place, placed on a **golden ingot**. It reacts violently (light and vibration) when you want to take it. It can be put in ice water to calm it down and taken away without attracting Akarite zealots.
Possible locations of the hiding place: behind the small pagoda, or behind the wall fresco, or under the floor in the middle of the room ...

Summaries
===================

Example of a timed sequence
---------------------------------

- 0: the hill is pierced by the explosion
- 5: arrival on the ground of the aquifer cavern
- 70: If the players are in the Holy of Holies of the temple, they hear the roar of the orb.
- 90: if the royal varan has not been managed, it wakes up and intercepts the players or carriers.
- 105 : Akarites arrive if pitch or smoke fumes have been released
- 120 : Akarites are coming in any case

**Delay** :

- most actions take **5mn**
- very short actions (e.g. asking another character for a known piece of information) are not counted
- long actions (e.g., bringing a heavy artifact back to camp) have specific timelines
- if the players argue too long to decide on the next step of their expedition, 5 minutes will pass...


Resaleable or exceptional finds
--------------------------------------------

In case the butler doesn't gather enough loot: the **exceptional artifacts** can be sold **between 20 and 30 kashes** on the black market, but it's a big risk of scandal (and legal trouble), in addition to a heartbreak for the scientists.
A poor palliative: players can agree to first have Alifir's Academy analyze the exceptional artifact, then simulate its theft to pay off Loyd Georges' debts.

The **wild beasts** (yeti, chlamydes, varan...) can be captured and sold **between 10 and 20 kashes** to a zoo, but the naturalist will have to be convinced.

- silver chalice: 5 kashes
- pierced coins: 5 kashes
- 3 pagan statues: 15 kashes
- brown guano (radioactive): 1/2 kash per kilo, 50 kilos recoverable at a rate of 1 kilo per person per minute
- stone arch of the yodic temple: exceptional artefact
- Akarite Warrior Statue: Exceptional Artifact
- crossentar: 10 kashes (except if exceptional artifact, at 1/3 chance)
- halberd: 10 kashes (except if exceptional artifact, at 1/3 chance)
- rusty grid: 10 kashes
- stone lantern: 5 kashes
- sacred scrolls: 10 kashes
- piled up objects: 10 kashes the set
- 5 tombstones: 10 kashes all together
- a kilo of real free gems is worth 10 kashes, and is collected in 5mn; one can collect in 6 kilos, but inside, 2 kilos of purple gems are **value free**.
- a kilo of encrusted diamonds is worth 15 kashes, and can be collected in 15 minutes; 1 kilo can be collected
- gold bullion: 10 kashes
- Divine Tear: Exceptional, unsaleable super mega artifact

**Other objects**: **black powder** can be recovered in the cave, 1 kilo of dry black powder is equivalent to a stick of dynamite; **old fuse** can also be found, slow combustion (1m/s).


Repatriation of interesting elements
-----------------------------------------

the butler must think of getting the heavy objects up as quickly as possible by the porters, in case their exploration is interrupted by the arrival of the natives.

A **return** from the Saint of the Saints to the base camp takes **20mn**, if not too busy.
So less time if the players are still only in the main cave, or if it's just their final return to base camp.
The best trick is to find a closer exit and approach the truck at the last moment.

**Examples of convoys**, with 2 carriers together :

- 3 pagan statues
- 5 tombstones
- Akarite warrior statue
- rusty grid (heavy)
- the rest: bulky objects from the pile, crossentar, sacred scrolls, stone lantern, halberd...

**The stone arch of the yodic temple** requires twice as many porters and twice as much time to bring it back.

Small objects (gems and ingots, divine tears...) can be carried in backpacks, without being a nuisance.


Naturalist survey
-------------------------

Summary of new species to be "caught" (in photo/video, or in flesh and blood): **blue water mushrooms, forest yeti, amphibious luminescent bats, blind well fish**

Summary of scientific developments :

- Pink earth fungi (which are white in the open air) produce a sleeping pill in their lightless metabolism.
- the imperial varan coexists with the chlamydes (the underground canal is the only possible way out for him)
- tombstone lichens produce a poisonous gas when deprived of light...
- the pearly fish in the well have lost their eyes and coloration over time.


Archaeological survey
----------------------------

The aim of the archaeologist is to demonstrate that the yodic temple, and the artifacts brought back, are an "archaeological scoop"; that they bring new elements on the end of the "razulite" yodic confession, which was crushed by its rival "taranite", 500 years ago.

The problem is that the locals were deliberately not very conspicuous, so that they would have a chance of getting away with it if they were discovered. Most of the objects that can be found are therefore certainly old - even prior to the era of the yodic conflicts - but relatively commonplace and widespread. Moreover, the distinctions between the yodic confessions are played out in minute theological details, which complicates the investigation.

Consequently, the archaeologist will have to redouble his efforts to support the various scientific theses.

To prove it's a yodic temple:

- find the crossentar (yodic symbol par excellence)
- find the rolled scrolls (yodic holy books, common to all confessions)
- to photograph the mural of the Saint of the Saints, typically yodic

To prove that he's of the Razulite faith:

- solve the riddle of the lantern in the well, which points to the vault a message in Akarite sacred runes
- if the halberd is an exceptional artefact, its inscriptions include Razulite currency.
- if the statue of the warrior Bartzar is brought back, 1/3 chance that it will eventually make the link with the Razulite confession.

To prove it was used after the fall of Nazur:

- the runic message from the ceiling (riddle of the lantern in the well) speaks of the fall of Nazur
- 1/6 chance that the analysis of the corpse gives convincing results (carbon-14 is imprecise)
- 1/6 chance that the micro inscriptions on the mural give calendar mentions
- by restoring the paintings on the tombstones (1/2 chance that it works), we can see that the dates of death are after the fall of Nazur.

**Historical summary**: a monotheistic church had long existed at the bottom of the cave, hence the west corridor and the underground bridge. The church has been forgotten in favour of a neopagan temple. The razulites of Nazur then dynamited the pagan temple, and "planed" the church to make it compatible. Then, chased by the Taranites, they reinvested the church, filling in the western entrance and creating a discreet new passage (north-east of the aquifer cave).


Berserk Elixir Quest
----------------------------

The adventurer is looking for the recipe for this legendary potion, the secret of which the razulites took with them in their decline.
For several hours, it increases the strength tenfold, and makes you insensitive to pain.

The corpse has a little bit of it, in the gold vial attached to his neck; but there is little chance that this will enable the recipe to be reconstructed (the mass spectrometer only gives atomic elements, not molecules, and the Alifir Academy is very poor at biochemistry).

The wall fresco of the Saint of the Saints gives the recipe of this potion, with pictograms of **goat, mushroom, round fruit, and water****.

- mushrooms are those that grow in the water of the crevices of the aquifer cave (not those in the open air)
- the goat skull has its horns planed, it's this powder that's used as an ingredient
- the tank has a deposit of red plum liqueur on the bottom.

Mixing these three elements gives the Berserk Elixir.

If he hasn't determined the exact ingredients, but has noted these pictograms, the adventurer is likely to find the right recipe in the long run, by **trying and error**.

if he has put the mass spectrometer in the shot, he also finds the right dose of each ingredient to put in to maximize the effect, and thus obtain a **double effectiveness**.


Possible fights
-----------------------

Fights are very rare, the idea is that players only face opponents if they are theoretically sure to win.

Initiative is either determined by the scenario (surprise effect) or by a 1/2 chance die roll.

Agility (= attack) of the main enemies :

- Woodland yeti: 3
- Chlamydyde in water: 3
- Chlamydyde out of water: 1
- Imperial Varan: 4
- Akarite peasant: 2 (with a scythe)
- Akarite Zealot: 3 (with a musket then a katana)
