                Protect all other members of the expedition, even at the cost of your life. More generally - and to your great regret - Loyd Georges hopes that there will be no injuries (and even fewer deaths) among potential Akarite aggressors, as this would lead to serious diplomatic unrest.

                Personally, you dream of getting your hands on the **Berserk Elixir Recipe**, a potion that gives temporary superhuman strength and insensitivity to pain, and whose Razulite confession took the secret away in its demise. It is up to you to ask your teammates for help in this quest.

                Exceptional archaeological finds are *legally* unsaleable, and are supposed to be left at the disposal of the Scientific Academy. You will therefore have to be careful to bring back artifacts of lower scientific value, and any valuable materials (even, why not, biological).
